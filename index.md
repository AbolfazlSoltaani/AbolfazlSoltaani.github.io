## About Me

I am a Bachelor of Science student with a strong interest in pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science. My research focuses on combinatorics, graph theory, and the design of algorithms, particularly in the areas of randomized, approximation, and parametrized algorithms.

I have had the opportunity to work on various research projects, including parametrized algorithms based on control flow graphs under the supervision of Prof. Amir Goharshady. I also worked on convex optimization problems in sublinear settings with Prof. Andreas Karrenbauer and explored algorithms with predictions under the guidance of Dr. Golnoosh Shahkarami.

When Iâ€™m not immersed in research, I enjoy playing video games and staying active through sports.
